# Health Portal System

Marshall Uni CS-310 project.

## Dev Notes

### Running both front/back ends.

You can run both applications concurrently with `npm run dev`.

### `client` folder

When working in the `client` folder, use `npm run build` before you try and test/review new material. Otherwise, the back end will not pick it up.
Running `npm run build` condenses and optimizes all front end materials into HTML/CSS and Javascript files. This is what the back end uses when deploying.
